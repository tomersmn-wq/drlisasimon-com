# Public Folder

## What This Folder Contains
The `public` folder stores static assets that are directly accessible to website visitors. These files are served as-is without any processing, like images, icons, and other media files.

## Intended Purpose
Public assets provide visual elements and resources:
- **Images**: Photos, logos, and graphics displayed on the website
- **Icons**: Small visual elements like favicons (the icon in browser tabs)
- **SVG Files**: Scalable vector graphics used for illustrations or icons

## Impact Examples

### Example 1: Replacing the Favicon
Changing `favicon.ico` will update the small icon that appears in browser tabs, bookmarks, and browser history, affecting brand recognition.

### Example 2: Adding New Images
Adding images to this folder makes them available for use throughout the website, enabling visual content updates without code changes.

### Example 3: Updating Logo Files
Modifying SVG or image files used for logos will change the visual branding across the site wherever those assets are referenced.

## Key Files
- `favicon.ico` - Browser tab icon
- Various SVG files - Scalable graphics and icons
