# High-Level Website Brief – Dr. Lisa Simon

## Purpose of This Document

This document serves as **context and a guiding brief** for building a new professional website for **Dr. Lisa Simon**, a psychologist. It is intended to be shared with AI tools (e.g., Cursor, Claude, etc.) and possibly human collaborators.

* **This document is written in English** and should remain so.
* **All actual website content must be in Hebrew**.
* The website must fully support **Hebrew language and RTL (right-to-left) layout**.

The goal is to define *what the website is*, *who it is for*, and *what it should communicate*, without getting into implementation-level details yet.

## High-Level Goals

1. Create a **beautiful, calm, professional, and trustworthy** website for a clinical psychologist.
2. Balance two identities:

3. Invite potential patients to feel **safe, understood, and confident** in reaching out.
4. Position Dr. Simon as a **serious, experienced professional**, without feeling cold or overly academic.
5. Ensure the site feels modern, minimal, and intentional — not generic or templated.
